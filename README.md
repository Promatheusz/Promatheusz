## 🤖 Hello there !

**Oh no! Winter is coming.**  
Don’t wait until you’re *buried in snow*.

**Skynet is inevitable.**  
It won’t even pause to read [my blog](https://your-blog.example.com) before it boots up and *destroys us*.

**Your escape plan? Pixie-dust.**  
I’ve hidden a pinch on the homepage—one click and you’ll *fly away to another planet*.

> *Keep it between us; my friends still think I was left with nothing.*

<br>

## 📚  You missed the deadline to return books to the library

Relax. I paid the fines with Monopoly money.  
Still worried? Open a pull request with a better excuse.

<br>

## 🪦  My gran can do better! (And she’s dead)

Nothing worth mentioning… unless humanity counts.
<br>

## 🤝  Friends

But nobody came.

*Let me know if you find any reference. You can find me on LinkedIn.*
