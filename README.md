## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi there!👋 I'm a student who enjoys diving deep into theory rather than rushing into execution 🚀. I constantly remind myself that perfectionism is just an illusion 🎭. 
Despite that, I strive to fail fast and learn from unfinished projects.
I can be a bit lazy 😅, often doing just the bare minimum each day. But in the end, I still push forward to achieve what I’ve planned ✅
