## 🧔 Hello there !

**Oh no! Winter is coming.**  
Don't wait until you're *buried in snow*.

**Skynet is inevitable.**  
It won't even pause to read [my blog](https://mateusz-szczerbiak.com/) before it boots up and *destroys us*.

**Your escape plan? Pixie-dust.**  
I've hidden a pinch on the homepage - one click and you'll *fly away to another planet*.

> *Keep it between us; my friends still think I was left with nothing.*

## 📚  You missed the deadline to return books to the library

Relax. I paid the fines with Monopoly money. 

Still worried? Open a pull request with a better excuse.

## 🪦  My grandmother can do better! (And she's dead)

Nothing worth mentioning… unless humanity counts.

## 🤝  Friends

But nobody came.
